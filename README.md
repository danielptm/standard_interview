### About
This is the java portion of the fullstack interview test

### Dependencies
1. Java11 is installed and working in your IDE
2. Maven is installed and able to install dependencies and build the code from your IDE

### Instructions:
1. Create an API method to consume a payload that contains a string.
2. Write a function that reverses the string. Do this from scratch without a java library provided function.
3. Write a unit test for this reverse string function.
4. Return the reversed string from the API method.

### If there's time:
1. Describe what mocking in unit tests is. Why do this? How is it done? How would you use it in this project. Say for example the string did not come from an API but came from a database. How would you write this code to use mocking to get the string. Assume that you have to get the string from the database and can't just pass it in through the method.
2. How would you do exception handling for this project? Why is your design good?
